AStar contains the visualization for Weighted A* search. EGraph contains the visualization for EGraph search. Each uses a javascript file with the same name yet
with "_old" attached to it. Currently working on refactoring the code to allow for the combination of these files into one html so that each mirrors the other in terms of
start, end, and obstacles.

AStar_EGraphs is the combined visualization for the two algorithms.
